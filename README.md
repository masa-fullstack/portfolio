<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./images/demo.gif)

Developed with NextJS + Contentful(Headless CMS).<br/>
For the NextJS template, we used the NextJS Typescript Boilerplate from the official examples.<br/>
In NextJS, HTML was created with SSG, and in the portfolio display area, pagenation and tag filter were realized with CSR.<br/>
CSR used the useReducer in React Hooks.<br/>
For CSS, we used Tailwindcss.<br/>
During development, we used docker-compose to build the development environment.<br/>
(I could have used "vercel dev", but I wanted to learn docker.)<br/>

When updating the content, it is possible to maintain it by simply updating the content with Contentful.

Thanks for viewing :)

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [NextJS Typescript Boilerplate](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-typescript-eslint-jest)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/5ZnOYsSXM24JWnCsNFlt) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/masa-fullstack/portfolio

# Change directory
$ cd portfolio

```

And you'll need to create Contentful space, content models.
The following seven content models are required.

- Personal
- Skills
- Hobbies
- SNS
- Experiences
- Tag
- Portofolios

I'll spare you the details.
(I plan to make it possible to import content models and test data into Contentful in the future.)

And put the Contentful access token and other information in ./app/.env.local
Finally, when you start Docker, the server will be listed on localhost:4001.

```bash

# Start Docker
$ docker-compose up

```
